#Bohnify
Bohnify consists of a server in node that supplies a websocket server and one prebuild HTML5client.
The server uses node-spotify which uses LibSpotify to stream music and browse metadata from Spotify.
It's the perfect solution if you want to play Spotify on an htpc or just let everyone control the music on a party.
